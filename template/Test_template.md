## ‚ÑπÔ∏è What is a Test ? 
A test in the 2048 Java project verifies the functionality of specific components, such as the **GameController**, **Grid**, or game mechanics. Tests are written using Java's testing framework (e.g., JUnit) to ensure the code behaves as expected under different scenarios.  
Each test typically follows these steps:  
1. **Arrange**: Set up the necessary objects and conditions.
2. **Act**: Execute the method or functionality being tested.
3. **Assert**: Check the results to verify that the behavior matches the expectations.


## üìã Test Name
<!-- Provide a clear and descriptive name for the test. -->
Give a name for the test to be able to know what it test quickly 
Example: "Verify tile merging functionality on upward swipe"


## üéØ Purpose
<!-- State the purpose of the test. What is being tested and why? -->
Explain the purpose of the test in a single sentence. 
Example: "Ensure tiles with the same value merge correctly when swiped upward."


## üõ†Ô∏è Additional Notes and recommandation 
Add any extra details that might be helpful for debugging or understanding the test.
Example : Consider edge cases, such as when the board is full or when no merges are possible.

### ‚úÖ Assertion 
**What are Assertions?** *Assertions* are statements used in tests to compare the expected outcome with the actual result. They are provided by testing frameworks like **JUnit** to automate the verification process. If an assertion fails, the test will stop and report the failure, indicating an issue in the code.

**How to Write Assertions in Java?** In *JUnit*, common assertion methods include:
- `assertEquals(expected, actual)` ‚Äì> Verifies that two values are equal.
- `assertTrue(condition)` ‚Äì> Checks that a condition is true.
- `assertFalse(condition)` ‚Äì> Checks that a condition is false.
- `assertNull(object)` ‚Äì> Confirms that an object is null.
- `assertNotNull(object)` ‚Äì> Confirms that an object is not null.
  
**Utility of Assertions**
- *Automated Validation*: Ensures the program behaves as expected without manual intervention.
- *Debugging*: Pinpoints the exact location and cause of failure in the code.
- *Regression Prevention*: Validates that new changes do not break existing functionality.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Console Output  
**What are Console Outputs?** Console outputs are textual information printed to the terminal or console during program execution. They are primarily used for debugging, logging, or verifying intermediate states when running or testing code.

**Tools for Console Output in Java**
1. System.out.println ‚Äì The simplest way to print text to the console.
2. System.err.println ‚Äì Used for printing error messages or logs to the error stream.
3. Logging Libraries (e.g., Log4j, SLF4J) ‚Äì Advanced tools for managing logs systematically across different levels (info, debug, error).

**Utility of Console Outputs**
- *Debugging*: Provides a quick way to inspect values and track program flow during execution.
- *Supplementary Information*: Helps when assertions are not sufficient to understand the issue.
- *Real-Time Feedback*: Useful for monitoring program behavior during runtime, especially for manual testing.

## üßæ Test Status
Mark the status of the test
- Passed
- Failed
- Blocked


## üìù Test Steps
<!-- Provide a structured example of the test. -->
Follow the next structure when writing the test 
### Test Code Example :
```java
  @Test
  public void testGameControllerStartGameDefault() {
      // Arrange
      GameController gc = new GameController();
  
      // Act
      gc.startGame();
      Grid grid = gc.getGrid();
  
      // Assert
      assertFalse(grid == null); // Grid should not be null after starting the game.
      assertTrue(gc.getGamestate() == GameState.running); // Game state should be set to running.
      assertTrue(gc.getScore() == 0); // Initial score should be 0.
      assertTrue(gc.getHighestScore() == 0); // Initial highest score should also be 0.
  }
```
**Arrange**
*Purpose*: Creates an instance of the GameController class, which is responsible for managing the game's main logic.
*Why*: Before testing the startGame method, we need an instance to simulate its behaviour.
**Act**
*Purpose*: Calls the startGame() method
*Why*: We want to check that the call to startGame() correctly configures all the elements needed to start a new game
**Assert**
*Purpose*: The assertions check whether the expected results correspond to those produced by the startGame() method.
*Why*: Make sure the game is working properly
